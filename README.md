## Requirement:
* Dash Ninja Back-end: https://github.com/elbereth/dashninja-be
* Dash Ninja Database: https://github.com/elbereth/dashninja-db
* Dash Ninja Front-End: https://github.com/elbereth/dashninja-fe
* PHP 5.6 with curl

Important: Almost all the scripts uses the private rest API to retrieve and submit data to the database (only dmnblockcomputeexpected uses direct MySQL access).

## Install:
* Go to /opt
* Get latest code from github:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/elbereth/dashninja-ctl.git
```
* Get sub-modules:
```shell
cd dashninja-ctl
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
* Configure the tool.

## Configuration:
* Copy dmn.config.inc.php.sample to dmn.config.inc.php and setup your installation.
* Add dmncron to your crontab (every minute is what official Dash Ninja uses)
```
*/1 * * * * /opt/dashninja-ctl/dmncron
```
If you want to enable logging, you need to create the log/ folder and give the user write access.
Then add "log" as first argument when calling dmncron:
```
*/1 * * * * /opt/dashninja-ctl/dmncron log
```
* Add dmnthirdpartiesfetch to your crontab (every minute is fine, can be longer)
```
*/1 * * * * /opt/dashninja-ctl/dmnthirdpartiesfetch >> /dev/null
```

### dashblocknotify:
* You need /dev/shm available and writable.
* Edit dashblocknotify.config.inc.php to indicates each of your nodes you wish to retrieve block info from.
* You can either retrieve block templates (bt = true) and/or block/transaction (blocks = true). For the later you need to have txindex=1 in your dash config file.
* Add in each of your nodes in dash.conf a line to enable blocknotify feature:
```
blocknotify=/opt/dashninja-ctl/dashblocknotify
```
* Restart your node.
* On each block received by the node, the script will be called and data will be created in /dev/shm.
